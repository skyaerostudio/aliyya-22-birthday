# Aliyya 22 â€” Docs Pack

Put the `docs/` folder in the root of your blank repo so Cursor can reference it before the first prompt.
Optional: also copy `.cursor-rules.json` and `.env.example` to the repo root.

**Kickoff:** paste the contents of `docs/cursor-master-prompt.txt` into Cursor and request unified diffs only.
